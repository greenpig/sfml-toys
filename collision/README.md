# Collision

Feng Zhou, Dec 2020

A trivial SFML game example.

 * Shape-based character drawing.
 * Keyboard input and 60fps game loop.
 * Collision detection based on geometry.
 * SFML compilation/building with sfml-vscode-boilerplate.
 * Just enough comments in code.

1. Open with VS Code

```
cd collision
code .
```

2. Debug with `Run -> Start Debugging`

3. Build MacOS app:

```
./build.sh
# App is in bin/Release/collision
```

4. How to use:

 * WASD to move player 1. IJKL to move player 2.
 * Sword causes health reduction when hit.
